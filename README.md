# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Learning Repository

Welcome to the DSA Learning Repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring and mastering various data structures and algorithms using Java. Whether you're just starting your DSA journey or looking to sharpen your skills, this repository is designed to help you learn by doing.

Each topic is organized into its own folder containing Java code examples and a corresponding Markdown file that explains the concepts and algorithms in detail. The goal is to provide both theoretical understanding and practical implementations, making it easier to grasp complex topics through hands-on practice.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured by topics. Each topic folder includes:

- **Java Code**: Implementations of data structures or algorithms to demonstrate practical usage.
- **Conceptual Documentation**: Markdown files that explain the theory, logic, and step-by-step process behind the code.

For example, a folder might be organized as above


This organization allows you to easily navigate through various DSA topics and dive into the specific areas you want to learn or review.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse Topics**: Start by exploring the folders to find the topics that interest you.
2. **Read the Documentation**: Open the Markdown files to understand the underlying concepts and algorithms.
3. **Review the Code**: Check out the Java implementations to see how the theory is applied in practice.
4. **Experiment and Learn**: Feel free to modify the code and test your own ideas. The repository is meant to be a learning resource, so experimentation is encouraged!
